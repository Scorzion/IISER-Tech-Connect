# IISER Tech Connect ✨

## 🚀 Empowering the Tech Pulse of IISER Bhopal

**IISER Tech Connect** is a web based prototype I built to reimagine the Google Developer Group (GDG) on Campus experience at IISER Bhopal. The aim is to foster a vibrant, inclusive, and tightly knit tech ecosystem that offers real opportunities for learning, mentorship, and industry exposure.

## 💡 The Problem We're Tackling

Despite the technical potential and research strength at IISER Bhopal, our GDG community has been facing a few pressing challenges:

* **Interdisciplinary Disconnect:** There’s a notable gap when it comes to integrating students from Physics, Chemistry, and Biology into tech driven efforts limiting the scope of innovative, cross domain solutions.

* **Unstructured Growth & Mentorship:** Many juniors struggle with direction there’s no consistent mentoring or long term project engagement. Events often happen in isolation without continuity or real world context.

* **Weak Industry & Alumni Pipeline:** There's limited access to alumni in product-based tech roles and a thin connection with industry professionals—both critical for guidance, networking, and internships.

## 🎯 My Purpose-Built Solution

**IISER Tech Connect** is my answer to these gaps a centralized, purpose-driven platform to bring coherence, mentorship, and opportunity to our growing tech community.

* **Interdisciplinary Collaboration:** Users can post or join research oriented tech projects, encouraging scientists and engineers to collaborate and think beyond their silos.

* **Structured Mentorship Programs:** A built in mentorship hub and guided learning paths give juniors the support they need to grow through pet projects and personalized development tracks.

* **Increased Engagement & Visibility:** A central dashboard for all GDG activities including personalized event recommendations—boosts community interaction and ownership.

* **Strong Industry + Alumni Gateway:** By integrating mentor profiles and professional connections, the platform opens new doors to insights, networking sessions, and career guidance from those already in the field.

## ✨ Key Features of the Prototype

This is a working prototype and includes the following core features:

1.  **User Authentication** – Secure sign-up/login via email and password.
2.  **Customizable User Profiles** – Users can update bios, list tech interests (e.g., AI, Bioinformatics), share contact details, and optionally declare availability as mentors.
3.  **Project Collaboration Hub** – A space to post, browse, and collaborate on interdisciplinary projects.
4.  **Mentorship Directory** – A searchable list of registered mentors with their skills and interests.
5.  **Events & Workshops Page** – A dynamic event board with a **"Get Personalized Recommendations"** feature (powered by simulated Gemini API) based on user interests.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

I chose tools that scale well and align with Google’s ecosystem:

* **Firebase:**
    * **Authentication:** Secure user login.
    * **Cloud Firestore:** Real-time, NoSQL database for storing user and project data.

* **Google IDX:** For modern, cloud-native development.

* **React:** My go to library for building a dynamic, component based UI.

* **Tailwind CSS:** For sleek, responsive, utility-first styling.

* **Gemini API (Simulated):** Intended for future use in personalized suggestions and content generation.

## 💻 Using the App

Here's a quick walkthrough:

1. **Register or Login** – Sign up using your email and password  
2. **Profile Tab** – Add your name, bio, interests (comma-separated), contact info, and mentor status  
3. **Projects Section** – Post your research or tech ideas, or explore others’ projects  
4. **Mentors Page** – Browse mentor profiles based on tech interests and connect directly  
5. **Events Page** – View upcoming GDG events, and use “Get Personalized Recommendations” for smart suggestions
