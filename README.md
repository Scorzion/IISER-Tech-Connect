## üöÄ Getting Started

This project is delivered as a single HTML file, making deployment incredibly straightforward!

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

* A **Google Account**

* A **GitHub Account** (if you plan to deploy using GitHub Pages)

### 1. Firebase Project Setup (Crucial!)

For the authentication and data storage features to work, you **must** configure your own Firebase project:

* **Create a Firebase Project:**
    1.  Navigate to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
    2.  Click **"Add project"** and follow the on-screen instructions to create a new project.

* **Add a Web App to Your Project:**
    1.  From your new Firebase project's overview, click the **web icon (`</>`)** to register a new web application.
    2.  Follow the registration steps. Firebase will provide you with a `firebaseConfig` JavaScript object. **Copy this entire object carefully.**

* **Enable Email/Password Authentication:**
    1.  In the Firebase Console, go to **"Authentication"** (under the "Build" section).
    2.  Click the **"Sign-in method"** tab.
    3.  Locate **"Email/Password"** and **enable it** by toggling the switch. Click **"Save"**.

* **Set Up Firestore Security Rules:**
    1.  In the Firebase Console, go to **"Firestore Database"** (under "Build").
    2.  Click on the **"Rules"** tab.
    3.  **Replace the existing rules** in the editor with the following to ensure proper data access:

        ```firestore
        rules_version = '2';
        service cloud.firestore {
          match /databases/{database}/documents {
            // Allow authenticated users to read/write public project data
            match /artifacts/{appId}/public/data/projects/{projectId} {
              allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
            }

            // Allow authenticated users to read/write their own private profile data
            match /artifacts/{appId}/users/{userId}/profile/data {
              allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
            }

            // Allow authenticated users to list user IDs (e.g., to find mentors)
            match /artifacts/{appId}/users/{userId} {
              allow read: if request.auth != null;
            }
          }
        }
        ```
    4.  Click **"Publish"** to apply the rules.

### 2. Update `index.html` with Your Firebase Configuration

* Open the `index.html` file (from the prototype code) in your preferred text editor.

* Locate the `<script type="module">` block, specifically the `firebaseConfig` variable (around line 50).

* **Replace the placeholder object** with the actual `firebaseConfig` object you copied from your Firebase Console.

    ```javascript
    const firebaseConfig = typeof __firebase_config !== 'undefined' ? JSON.parse(__firebase_config) : {
        // PASTE YOUR ACTUAL FIREBASE CONFIG HERE, e.g.:
        apiKey: "AIzaSyC-YOUR_API_KEY",
        authDomain: "your-project-id.firebaseapp.com",
        projectId: "your-project-id",
        storageBucket: "your-project-id.appspot.com",
        messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
        appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
    };
    ```
    *Ensure you uncomment the lines and replace `YOUR_...` with your specific values.*

### 3. Running the Prototype Locally (Optional)

For a quick local test (recommended for Firebase functionality):

* Navigate to the directory containing `index.html` in your terminal.

* Run a simple Python HTTP server:
    ```bash
    python -m http.server
    ```

* Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8000`.

### 4. Deploying to GitHub Pages

Share your prototype with the world!

1.  **Create a New GitHub Repository:** If you haven't already, create a new **public** repository on GitHub (e.g., `iiser-tech-connect`).

2.  **Upload `index.html`:** Add (or commit) your modified `index.html` file directly to the **root** of your repository.

3.  **Enable GitHub Pages:**
    * Go to your repository's **"Settings"** tab.
    * In the left sidebar, click **"Pages"**.
    * Under "Build and deployment", select **"Deploy from a branch"** for the source.
    * For "Branch", choose your primary branch (usually `main`) and select `/ (root)` for the folder.
    * Click **"Save"**.

4.  **Access Your Live Site:** GitHub Pages will now build and deploy your site. This usually takes a few minutes. Once complete, you'll find the live URL under the "Pages" section (e.g., `https://your-username.github.io/your-repo-name/`).

## üíª How to Use the App
